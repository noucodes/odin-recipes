    <h1>The Secret to Making Korean Hot Wings at Home</h1>

    <p>
      Let's face it: All chicken wings are pretty much the best snack or party
      food ever invented. But Korean-style chicken wings, with their crispy
      fried exterior surrounded by sauce, may be the best of the best. How these
      wings keep a perfect crisp while not having a heavy layer of crust (like
      American-style wings) is a secret technique that I'm here to share.
      Because everyone should be able to make (and enjoy) Korean-style chicken
      wings at home.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>
      <li>¾ cup dark brown sugar</li>
      <li>¼ cup ketchup</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons barbeque sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha) (Optional)</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Asian (toasted) sesame oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
      <li>1 quart peanut oil for frying, or as needed</li>
      <li>4 pounds chicken wings</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons lemon-pepper seasoning, or to taste (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Stir soy sauce, brown sugar, ketchup, barbeque sauce, <br />
        garlic, vinegar, chile-garlic sauce, pepper, sesame oil, <br />
        and ginger together in a saucepan; bring to a boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk cornstarch and water together in a small bowl; stir <br />
        into sauce. Remove from heat and set aside to cool and thicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 360 degrees <br />
        F (182 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>Season chicken wings with lemon-pepper seasoning.</li>
      <li>
        Fry chicken wings in batches of 6 to 8 at a time in hot oil <br />
        until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, <br />
        6 to 8 minutes per batch. An instant-read thermometer <br />
        inserted into the meatiest part of the wing, near the bone, <br />
        should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Place cooked wings into a large mixing bowl. Ladle sauce over <br />
        the wings and toss to coat.
      </li>
      <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
